# Heart Disease Model Comparison

This project compares two machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

The goal is to predict heart disease using a medical dataset.

## Models Compared
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Files Included
- heart_model_comparison.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with full implementation
- heart.csv → Dataset used
- README.md → Project documentation

## Conclusion
Random Forest achieved higher performance compared to Logistic Regression for this dataset.
